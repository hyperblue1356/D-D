Nightstone is a fortified settlement located a few
miles south of the Ardeep Forest, in the untamed hills
between Waterdeep and Daggerford. A lonely wooden
signpost, standing where the trail to Nightstone meets
the High Road, points the way to the settlement.
Nightstone's closest neighbors are the elves of the
Ardeep Forest. Hunters from Nightstone have incurred
the elves' wrath on multiple occasions.

Nightstone got its name from a massive chunk of
obsidian that once stood in the middle of the village
square. The obsidian megalith had strange glyphs
carved into it and radiated magic under the scrutiny
of detect magic spells, but its properties and purpose
couldn't be ascertained. The villagers assumed it was a
relic of some bygone age or kingdom and left it alone.
